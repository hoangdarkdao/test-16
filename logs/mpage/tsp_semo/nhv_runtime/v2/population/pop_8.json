          "algorithm": "{The new heuristic function 'select_neighbor' begins by analyzing the archive to identify solutions with high edge crossings or non-dominated fronts, then applies a novel hybrid local search strategy that combines a multi-segment shuffle with a guided edge insertion, where the shuffle randomly reorders multiple segments of the tour while the insertion strategically places nodes based on their relative costs in both objective spaces, ensuring feasibility by validating the solution and repairing any invalid cycles through a minimal perturbation mechanism. The function prioritizes diversity in the archive by selecting solutions with high crowding distances and uses a dynamic edge selection criterion that balances the reduction of both objectives, while maintaining tour validity through a cycle validation step and a fallback mechanism to revert to the original solution if the neighbor is infeasible.}",
