Next, it selects the most promising candidate through tournament selection, favoring solutions with higher diversity and better objective values. For local search, it employs a hybrid strategy combining edge inversion and segment relocation, where segments of the tour are either inverted or relocated to different positions while maintaining feasibility. The algorithm ensures feasibility by strictly enforcing the TSP constraints (no node repetition or omission) and uses the provided distance matrices to evaluate the quality of generated neighbors. The process iteratively refines the solution by accepting improvements in either objective while maintaining Pareto dominance, and terminates when no further improvements are found.}",
