Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the solution must represent a valid TSP tour: it visits each node exactly once, ensuring no node is skipped or revisited.Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have one algorithm with its code as follows.

Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have one algorithm with its code as follows.

Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives.

        "prompt": "You are solving a Bi-objective Travelling Salesman Problem (bi-TSP), where each node has two different 2D coordinates: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), representing its position in two objective spaces. The goal is to find a tour visiting each node exactly once and returning to the starting node, while minimizing two objectives simultaneously: the total tour length in each coordinate space. Given an archive of solutions, where each solution is a numpy array representing a TSP tour, and its corresponding objective is a tuple of two values (cost in each space), design a heuristic function named 'select_neighbor' that selects one solution from the archive and apply a novel or hybrid local search operator to generate a neighbor solution from it.  Must always ensure that the generated neighbor solution remains feasible, i.e., the solution must represent a valid TSP tour: it visits each node exactly once, ensuring no node is skipped or revisited.Please perform an intelligent random selection from among the solutions that show promising potential for further local improvement. Using a creative local search strategy that you design yourself, avoid 2-opt, go beyond standard approaches to design a method that yields higher-quality solutions across multiple objectives. The function should return the new neighbor solution.\nI have 2 existing algorithms with their codes as follows:\nNo. 1 algorithm and the corresponding code are:\n{This new algorithm selects a solution from the archive based on a Pareto-dominance-inspired selection, then applies a novel node insertion and edge reversal strategy to generate a neighbor solution while ensuring feasibility.}\ndef select_neighbor(archive: List[Tuple[np.ndarray, Tuple[float, float]]], instance: np.ndarray, distance_matrix_1: np.ndarray, distance_matrix_2: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    objectives = np.array([obj for _, obj in archive])\n    non_dominated_indices = []\n    for i in range(len(objectives)):\n        dominated = False\n        for j in range(len(objectives)):\n            if i != j and (objectives[j][0] <= objectives[i][0] and objectives[j][1] <= objectives[i][1]) and (objectives[j][0] < objectives[i][0] or objectives[j][1] < objectives[i][1]):\n                dominated = True\n                break\n        if not dominated:\n            non_dominated_indices.append(i)\n\n    if non_dominated_indices:\n        selected_idx = np.random.choice(non_dominated_indices)\n    else:\n        selected_idx = np.random.choice(len(archive))\n\n    base_solution = archive[selected_idx][0].copy()\n    new_solution = base_solution.copy()\n    n = len(new_solution)\n\n    # Novel node insertion and edge reversal strategy\n    i, j = sorted(np.random.choice(n, 2, replace=False))\n    node_to_insert = new_solution[j]\n\n    # Remove node j and insert it between i and i+1\n    new_solution = np.concatenate((new_solution[:j], new_solution[j+1:]))\n    insert_pos = np.random.randint(1, len(new_solution))\n    new_solution = np.insert(new_solution, insert_pos, node_to_insert)\n\n    # Reverse a random segment to create diversity\n    k, l = sorted(np.random.choice(n-1, 2, replace=False))\n    new_solution[k:l+1] = new_solution[k:l+1][::-1]\n\n    # Ensure feasibility\n    assert len(np.unique(new_solution)) == n, \"Invalid tour generated\"\n\n    return new_solution\n\nNo. 2 algorithm and the corresponding code are:\n{}\ndef select_neighbor(archive: List[Tuple[np.ndarray, Tuple[float, float]]], instance: np.ndarray, distance_matrix_1: np.ndarray, distance_matrix_2: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    best_idx = np.argmin([obj[0] + obj[1] for _, obj in archive])\n    base_solution = archive[best_idx][0].copy()\n\n    # Hybrid local search: combine 2-opt with a novel edge-swap strategy\n    new_solution = base_solution.copy()\n    n = len(new_solution)\n\n    # Randomly select two edges to break\n    i, j = sorted(np.random.choice(n, 2, replace=False))\n\n    # Novel edge-swap: reverse the segment between i and j, then swap two random nodes in the segment\n    new_solution[i:j+1] = new_solution[i:j+1][::-1]\n    if j - i > 1:\n        k, l = np.random.choice(range(i, j+1), 2, replace=False)\n        new_solution[k], new_solution[l] = new_solution[l], new_solution[k]\n\n    # Ensure the solution remains feasible (no duplicates or missing nodes)\n    assert len(np.unique(new_solution)) == n, \"Invalid tour generated\"\n\n    return new_solution\n\n\nPlease help me create a new algorithm that has a totally different form from the given ones but can be motivated from them.\n1.
