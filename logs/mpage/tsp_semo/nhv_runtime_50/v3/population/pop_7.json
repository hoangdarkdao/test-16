The method first identifies the Pareto-frontier solutions in the archive, then selects a base solution probabilistically weighted by its dominance and diversity, followed by a two-stage perturbation: 1) a constrained segment inversion that preserves node connectivity, and 2) a multi-objective-aware edge swap that prioritizes improvements in both objectives while ensuring feasibility through a validation check.

It first identifies the most promising solutions by evaluating their dominance relationships and combined objective values, then employs a weighted random selection to choose a base solution with higher probability for better-performing solutions. The algorithm then performs a hybrid segment exchange operation where it selects two non-overlapping segments from different parts of the tour and exchanges them, evaluating the impact on both objectives. The acceptance criterion considers both objectives simultaneously, accepting the change if it improves at least one objective or with a small probability if it doesn't. The algorithm also includes a fallback mechanism to ensure solution feasibility and a dynamic adjustment of segment sizes based on the solution's quality. The approach goes beyond standard segment-based operations by incorporating multi-objective considerations throughout the process and dynamically adapting the segment sizes during the search.}",

The new algorithm will employ a multi-stage local search strategy that combines an objective-aware edge insertion with a geometric segment inversion, where the selection of edges and segments is guided by the instance's coordinate data to identify high-potential regions for improvement. The method will first normalize the objectives to create a combined score, then select a base solution probabilistically, followed by a two-phase perturbation: 1) an objective-aware edge insertion that identifies and inserts edges that improve both objectives, and 2) a geometric segment inversion that dynamically selects and inverts segments based on their spatial properties in both coordinate spaces to explore the neighborhood while ensuring feasibility through a validation check and permutation repair mechanism if needed.}",
