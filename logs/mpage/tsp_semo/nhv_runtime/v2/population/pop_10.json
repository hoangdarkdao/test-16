Additionally, the function incorporates a guided edge insertion step that strategically places nodes based on their relative costs in both objective spaces, while prioritizing diversity by favoring solutions with high crowding distances in the archive. The algorithm dynamically adjusts its search strategy based on the current archive state, favoring exploration when diversity is high and exploitation when convergence is detected, resulting in high-quality solutions across multiple objectives.}",
