Following this, an \"adaptive edge reinforcement\" step selectively strengthens or weakens edges based on their contribution to improving both objectives, with a \"bi-objective edge selection\" mechanism that evaluates each edge's impact on both objectives before modification. The method includes a \"path topology preservation\" validation step that ensures the solution maintains structural diversity while improving the objectives, and employs a \"multi-objective edge optimization\" phase to refine the tour by replacing edges with alternatives that offer better trade-offs between the objectives, all while maintaining tour feasibility through a comprehensive validation mechanism.}",
